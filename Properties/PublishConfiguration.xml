## Vehicle Driver
# Brief Usage:
1. Load your save game and select vehicle
2. Press Enter to take over the vehicle and drive it
3. Use Arrows to drive, H for handbrake
4. Press Enter to release the vehicle never ESC
		
Known Issues:
- Null Reference Exception (NRE) time-bomb crash after releasing accident-involved vehicles that happen too under user control.
- ESC key cannot be used to cancel driving; please use ENTER instead, think this causes crash atm.
- Driving is currently restricted to a horizontal plane, due to a conflict with the OutOfControlSystem, which handles proper terrain and net collision queries but causes jitter as its fighting mod movement. Simply not finished implementation.

# As designed:
- Prevents driving involved in accident vehicle
